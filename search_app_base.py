"""
Hello,

This is a primitive 'search engine'. It takes a file with queries and then
matchs and scores against a datatset of lines
consisting of 3 elements [id, item, brand].
It outputs the numberof matches per query, the items matached and
their score ordered by descending score.

Scoring could be improved as only measuring:print
Number of key-word occurances in entry
Full match but non-case sensitive
Partial match on word beginnin

names of files:

queries.txt
search_dataset.csv

Ruins on Python 2 and 3
